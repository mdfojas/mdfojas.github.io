		<h3>MY CHILDHOOD DREAMS</h3><br>
		<p>When I was younger, I wanted to be a pilot so I can go around the world, bus soon I realized we don't have the capacity for that. Then I wanted to be a doctor because it sounds fun even though it is surely hard. But then after examining in up, I didn't passed the BS Bio and then I enrolled in CS because this is my second choice. But nevertheless I am enjoying here at CS, my dream since I started gaming was to create my own game, and my own company. It never stops, I will persevere in this course so that I can accomplish my dream and have my own gaming company and produce games as much as I want to.
