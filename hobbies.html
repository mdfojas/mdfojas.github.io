			<h3>MY HOBBIES</h3><br>
			<p>I've got many hobbies, my recent is biking, i finished most of my exercise by late november last sem so I had many time, I bought a bike and started cycling. Sometimes I play instruments, I have a guitar, violin, and a piano or keyboard. I also love watching anime or documentary stuffs so I can learn or for entertainment use. Sometimes I play, but even though I like playing, I hate playing. I know it's paradoxical but when I play, sometimes I enjoy it, sometimes i get stressed out by my teammates.  Rip. Thank you for reading this, have a good day!</p>
